## Project title
memoryJs - it is an educational tool in the form of a memory game to help beginner coders learn the language and syntax of javascript. Also, because of the timed feature it will help to train their thinking to process and recall code faster with practice.

## Motivation
This project exists because of my own struggles as beginner javascript coder. I searched on the internet for a tool to help make learning the basics of javascript fun and educational but I did not find anything satisfactory. So was born the idea of creating a game to help future JS learners or even those who may want to brush up on their skills.

## Code Style
Javascript, CSS and HTML
